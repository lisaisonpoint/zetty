# Blocky
It is the useable algorithm. It groups numbers with similarities and sends them through the LZMA-algorithm afterwards. LZMA is an algorithm which is used in 7-zip. 

# istream
istream is used to convert the compressed data back into a format which is usable by OpenFOAM


# ostream
ostream is used to output the data as the compressed file format


# streambuf
streambuf is in charge of the reading and writing operations
it includes the methods sync, underflow and overflow
  
### sync
if data is entered but neither underflow nor overflow is called, sync writes that data into the stream-buffer sometimes
### underflow
if the stream-buffer is empty and there is an attempt to remove values from it this method is called
### overflow
if the stream-buffer is full and there is an attempt to put more data into it this method is called
